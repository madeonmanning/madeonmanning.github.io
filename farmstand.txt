d:["$","$Lb","8",{"question":"Do you ever sell custom baked goods?","answer":"Yes! I do take custom orders as my schedule allows.

f:["$","$Lb","10",{"question":"What happens to the farmcart when it is not summer time?","answer":"During the colder months, I switch to a \"porch pickup\" model of selling my baked goods.

The week before a porch pickup, I will send out an email with a link to an order form. You fill out what you would like to order and then it will be waiting for you on the pickup date.<br /><br />If you would like to stay in the loop about upcoming porch pickup dates, <a href=\"./about#subscribe\">sign up to be on my email list here</a>.<br /><br />You can find any currently scheduled porch pickups on the <a href=\"./events\">events page</a>."}]
